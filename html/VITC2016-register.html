            <p class="info">Vancouver International Trade Conference (VITC) sets the table for contentious and unconventional topics in International Trade. With “Fortune Favours the Bold” as the theme, we aim to encapsulate Vancouver herself. She is young, vibrant, and diverse, with a global mindset, dead set on exploring new frontiers.
              <br>
              <br> Vancouver’s students, academics and entrepreneurs best embody the above description. They also make up our target audience, though guests from across Canada and abroad are welcome and expected. We aim to host 300 such individuals at the conference this year. The topics they will be tuned into are broadly: the Trans-Pacific Partnership, International Dispute Resolution, Cultural
              <br> Exchange and Financial Markets.
              <br>
              <br> The conference is set, to immediately follow the Reading Break, for 25th February 2016. This is the best time to catch students just returning from varied volunteer experiences with few academic commitments. Also, with only half a term left for summer, it will be the best chance for entrepreneurs to connect with them for summer opportunities and tag the internationals before they return home.
              <br>
              <br> The Robert H. Lee Alumni Centre will be welcoming us as we set up in Jack Poole Hall for a day of engaged, entangled, literary fun!</p>

            <p class="para">Apply to Present! Deadline: 5th February 2016</p>
            <p class="info">Vancouver International Trade Conference (VITC) will have a broad audience and is a great place to pitch your idea to the world. If you've presented elsewhere, you're still welcome to present again here. &nbsp;The presentation should be academic or experiential in nature. We would prefer topics under those listed in the next tab: Topics and Speakers. We are willing to accept a few presentations outside the scope of this conference, so long it is relevant to international trade.
              <br>
              <br>Remember: “Fortune Favours the Bold.” Please fill in the form below.</p>

            <p class="para">"Fortune Favours the Bold"</p>
            <p class="info">We've just turned the corner into 2016. Our resolution this year was to take some chances. Many of you perhaps have listed this too? For tradition's sake? Or perhaps you've given up on resolutions by now. No matter, we offer you a chance to reignite that will power, a chance to check one resolution off the list! At the very least, you'll get a rush watching others take the step as we tackled controversial and unconventional topics this 25/2.
              <br>
              <br><strong data-new-link="true">Trans Pacific Partnership</strong>
              <br>The deals are done and now the jury's out. There's immense political, social and economic pressure around this deal and it foreshadows twins across the Atlantic. Is it really as make-or-break as it's made out to be? What do the facts say? Join the debate and hear from experts!
              <br>
              <br><strong data-new-link="true">International Dispute Resolution</strong>
              <br>Following right on the heels of the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), we dare to churn it's most contentious chapter. Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) is right up our street. By-passing of the Justice system has riled many. It's time we put it on trial!
              <br>
              <br><strong data-new-link="true">Cultural Exchange</strong>
              <br>TPP or not, Vancouver will always be Canada's access to Asia. We have expertise here, and moreover, the diversity to facilitate transnational trade. Let’s boil it down to the essence of our identities and brands through story, and connect with each other to harness Vancouver's great diversity. For peace and enterprise.
              <br>
              <br><strong data-new-link="true">Financial Markets&nbsp;</strong>
              <br>We can't talk about trade without talking of money! We bring you, not just any money, but new money! As you explore the Pacific, it'll only be a matter of time before Islamic Finance hits your ears. We thought we'll just bring it right to you. Turn the corner and we get you Blockchain Fintech too! It's a bit of a mouthful, but if you've heard of Bitcoin, you'll want to hear of this!
              <br>
              <br>We are in contact with several speakers and presenters and in the long journey to line them up for a fabulous 25th. We will be releasing names as we confirm them. Meanwhile, why not put your own in for the toss?</p>
          </div>
          <div class="w-tab-pane conftab" data-w-tab="Tab 4">
            <p class="para">We're a Brand. We know Brands.</p>
            <p class="info">International Trade. That's what this institution is all about. Working out of Vancouver, our greatest interest is of course the Pacific. Our experience in these waters is great. Our aim is to be unmatched. On the metaphor of traversing seas, we cannot do it alone. We need crew and provisions. Come, let's take your name to new places!
              <br>
              <br><strong data-new-link="true">Research</strong>
              <br>As the thirst for knowledge is never satiated, the quest for research funding never ends. We are in active search of opportunities and happy to take up relevant research requests. It will allow us to keep regular academics and aid in hiring of students.
              <br>
              <br>Research results will feed into our two journals. The journals are open-source for the largest possible audience and it'd be a pleasure to dedicate a page to recognize generosity.
              <br>
              <br data-new-link="true"><strong>Conference</strong>
              <br>This conference is set to host more than 300 students, academics and SME representatives. This provides a great marketing opportunity to anyone with a stake in cross-border work, SME services or a student customer base. It’s also a great hiring opportunity too if more money is set aside for
              <br> that.
              <br>
              <br> Before the conference, a great chance to reach many people is to join us in marketing the event. We will be sharing invitation cards across campuses and business venues and your name could be on it! The same applies to the rest of our marketing materials including brochures, posters and this very information package. Perhaps even a spot on our web spaces too. We will be going all out during Reading Week, with a team of 5 to 8 all day every day.
              <br>
              <br> During the conference, there are even more opportunities! The venue, Robert H. Lee Alumni Centre, is centrally located on the UBC Vancouver campus. With the student nest flanking it, foot traffic can exceed 5,000 a day. Take advantage of boothing, digital signage, goodie bags or the traditional lanyard.
              <br>
              <br> After the conference, there’s still time to make it onto our e-newsletter to directly
              <br> reach our 400 guests.
